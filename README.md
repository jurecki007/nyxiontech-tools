**If this saved you a trip to an upload site, a star helps the next person find it.** There is nothing to sign up for and nothing to buy.

## Why

- **Your files never leave your device.** Every tool runs in the browser and there is no backend to upload to. The Content-Security-Policy only lets the page connect to its own origin, so it couldn't send your documents anywhere else. The Windows app works fully offline.
- **Free, with no limits.** No account, no sign-up, no daily task limit, no watermark, no tracking.
- **Redaction that really removes the text.** Redacted pages are re-rendered as images with the boxes burnt in, and comments and form-field values that contain the searched text are removed too. The tests check the output for leaks.
- **Open source** (AGPL-3.0): read the code, or host your own copy with the included Docker image.
- **Windows app** with per-user and MSI installers that updates itself.

It covers the everyday jobs people otherwise use iLovePDF, Smallpdf and similar services for: [merge](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/merge-pdf), [compress](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/compress-pdf), [sign](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/sign-pdf), [redact](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/redact-pdf), [OCR](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/ocr-pdf), [password-protect](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/protect-pdf), [PDF to Word](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/pdf-to-word), [HEIC to JPG](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/heic-to-jpg) and [more](#dashboard-tools). Projects are autosaved in the browser's IndexedDB.

There are 32 how-to guides as well, [in English](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/guides) and [in Polish](https://tools.nyxiontech.com/pl/poradniki): what actually happens inside the file, where the usual advice goes wrong, and which tool finishes the job. The Polish set is written for Polish rules rather than translated.

## Download

- **Web:** use it at **[tools.nyxiontech.com](https://tools.nyxiontech.com)**, or host it yourself (below).
- **Windows 10/11:** get the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/jurecki007/nyxiontech-tools/releases/latest):
  - `Nyxiontech.PDF.Tools_<version>_x64-setup.exe`: installs for the current user, no admin rights needed.
  - `…_x64_en-US.msi`: per-machine installer for IT rollout (Intune, Group Policy).

  The app updates itself: when a new version is released, it offers to install it. Updates are signed, and the app refuses any that are not. To stop the app from checking, untick **Check for updates automatically** under **About**.

  To uninstall: Windows Settings → Apps → Installed apps → Nyxiontech PDF Tools → Uninstall.

See the [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md): the web app sends nothing anywhere, and the desktop app only asks GitHub for the latest version number.

### Why does Windows warn me?

The installers are not code-signed yet: the application to [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/) is pending (see [Code signing policy](#code-signing-policy)). Until then, Windows SmartScreen shows **"Windows protected your PC"** for a new download from an unknown publisher. It is a warning about reputation, not a virus detection. To install, click **More info → Run anyway**.

To check that your download is the file GitHub Actions built from this repository, compare its SHA-256 hash with the `sha256:` digest that GitHub shows next to each file on the [release page](https://github.com/jurecki007/nyxiontech-tools/releases/latest):

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\Nyxiontech.PDF.Tools_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe   # SHA256 by default
```

You can also build the installers yourself from source (see [Windows desktop app](#windows-desktop-app)).

## Code signing policy

Free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io/), certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

Windows installers are built from this repository by the [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) on GitHub Actions and signed only after a manual approval for each release.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5180
```

On Windows you can also double-click `start.bat`.

`npm run build` produces a static site in `dist/` that can be served by any web server.

### Tests

End-to-end tests use Playwright (`tests/e2e`). They cover the dashboard, the editor and every tool, and check the downloaded files with pdf-lib and pdf.js.

```bash
npm run test:e2e          # builds, serves the production build on :4173, runs the suite (~3 min)
npm run test:e2e:report   # opens the HTML report
```

- Test documents are generated in `tests/global-setup.ts` and contain no real data.
- Tests use the installed Google Chrome. Set `PW_CHANNEL=chromium` after `npx playwright install chromium` to use Playwright's own browser (CI does this).
- Tests run with one worker, because OCR and the AI model use a lot of memory.
- `vite preview` sends the same security headers as nginx (read from `nginx/security-headers.conf`), so the tests run under the production Content-Security-Policy. The dev server (`npm run dev`) cannot send it: React Fast Refresh needs an inline script.

Not covered: the print dialog itself in "Word to PDF" (the tests check the document handed to it). HEIC conversion (Images to PDF, HEIC to JPG, OCR) is tested with a synthetic sample (`tests/fixtures/sample.heic`) under the real Content-Security-Policy. For the desktop app see below.

## Self-hosting

The app is a static site, so any web server works. With Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d   # http://localhost:8080
```

`docker-compose.yml` builds the included image (nginx serving the build) and runs it with a read-only filesystem, no volumes, no environment and nothing to persist. There is no backend and no database to set up, because documents are processed in the browser and never reach the container. Publish a different port by editing the `ports` line. Without Compose:

```bash
docker build -t nyxiontech-pdf-tools .
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 nyxiontech-pdf-tools   # http://localhost:8080
```

Or without building anything, from the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/jurecki007/nyxiontech-tools:latest
```

The published image covers `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, so an x86 server and an ARM
home box pull the same tag. `:latest` and the version tag follow published releases, and
`:edge` follows `master`. The site is static and the nginx stage runs no commands, so the
build happens once on the builder's own architecture and both images serve identical files.
`.github/workflows/image.yml` builds the amd64 image, starts it and asks it for real pages
before anything is pushed, so a broken image never reaches the registry.

- Every tool has its own page (`/merge-pdf`, `/pl/polacz-pdf`, ...), built as `merge-pdf.html`, `pl/polacz-pdf.html`. nginx serves `$uri`, then `$uri.html`, then `$uri/index.html`; a trailing slash on a page redirects to the address without it, and any other address gets `404.html` with a 404 status. Another web server needs the same rules (or at least a fallback to `index.html`, which opens the dashboard).
- `/health` returns `{"status":"UP"}` for liveness and readiness probes, and is what the Compose health check polls. It asks for `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost`, because nginx listens on IPv4 only and `localhost` inside the container resolves to `::1` first.
- `/info` returns the name, version and build time.
- Hashed `/assets/*` are cached for a year, `/vendor/*` (OCR and ML files) for a week, and `index.html` is always revalidated.
- A strict Content-Security-Policy allows only this origin, plus WebAssembly and blob workers (`nginx/security-headers.conf`).
- There is no backend: documents never reach the server.

**Hosted copy:** [tools.nyxiontech.com](https://tools.nyxiontech.com) runs on Cloudflare Pages, built from `master` on every push (build command `npm run build`, output `dist`, Node version from `.nvmrc`). `public/_headers` sends the same security headers as the nginx image, and the build fails if they drift apart (`scripts/check-pages-headers.mjs`). `public/_redirects` provides `/health`. Pages serves `merge-pdf.html` at `/merge-pdf` and `pl/index.html` at `/pl/` without redirects, and because the build includes a `404.html`, unknown addresses get a real 404 instead of the app. The site also serves `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` (generated by the build), `llms.txt` (a summary for AI assistants), a web manifest and `.well-known/security.txt`. The home page's canonical URL and structured data are in `index.html`; the tool pages get theirs from the build (see [Search pages](#search-pages)).

### Install as an app

In Chrome or Edge the web app can be installed: click **Install app** in the sidebar (it appears only when the browser offers installation, and never in the Windows app), or use the install icon in the address bar.

- **Open PDFs from your computer.** Once installed, the app is listed under "Open with" for PDFs and images (JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, HEIC) on Windows, macOS, Linux and ChromeOS (`file_handlers` in `public/site.webmanifest`). PDFs open in the editor as if dropped on the dashboard; images open in Images to PDF. Chrome asks once before the app may read an opened file.
- **Share to it** from other apps (`share_target`): on Android, and on desktop systems whose share menu supports it. The browser posts the files to `/share-target`.
- **Service worker** (`public/sw.js`): there is no backend, so a small service worker answers that POST. It keeps the shared files in memory until the page picks them up (at most a minute), caches nothing and makes no requests. `worker-src 'self'` in the Content-Security-Policy already allows it, so the policy is unchanged.
- Firefox and Safari can still use the web app (Safari can add it to the Dock or home screen) but don't support opening files with it or sharing to it.

To try it locally: `npm run build && npx vite preview`, open http://localhost:4173 in Chrome, install it, then right-click a PDF and choose "Open with". `tests/e2e/pwa.spec.ts` checks the manifest, the service worker, opening and sharing files, and the install button.

### Windows desktop app

The same build also ships as a Windows desktop app ([Tauri 2](https://tauri.app)): the app window is the system WebView2 (Edge), and everything still runs on the computer.

```bash
npm run desktop:dev       # app window on the Vite dev server, with hot reload
npm run desktop:build     # builds the web app, then the exe and both installers
npm run desktop:build:offline  # the same installers with WebView2 inside, for offline machines
npm run test:desktop      # smoke tests of the built exe (~30 s)
```

Building needs [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (stable, MSVC) and the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools. Output in `src-tauri/target/release/`:

- `nyxiontech-pdf-tools.exe`: the app on its own (the web build is embedded). Runs on any Windows 10/11 machine with WebView2, which Windows 11 includes.
- `bundle/nsis/Nyxiontech PDF Tools_<version>_x64-setup.exe`: per-user installer (~35 MB).
- `bundle/msi/Nyxiontech PDF Tools_<version>_x64_en-US.msi`: per-machine installer for IT rollout (Intune, Group Policy).
- `…_offline-setup.exe` and `…_offline.msi` (~240 MB, from `desktop:build:offline`): the same, with the full WebView2 installer inside.

On a fresh machine the app needs nothing but WebView2: the C/C++ runtime is linked into the exe, and the other DLLs are part of Windows 10/11. Windows 11 and updated Windows 10 already have WebView2. If it is missing, the normal installers download it (so they need internet), and the offline installers install the copy they carry. The bare exe never installs it. Windows 7/8 are not supported.

How it differs from the web build:

- **Saving** opens a native "Save as" dialog. The page has no file-system access of its own: it can only call the app's `save_file` command (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`), which always asks the user.
- **Links** to websites or e-mail (e.g. in a Word preview) open in the default browser; the window never leaves the app.
- **Content-Security-Policy** is the one in `nginx/security-headers.conf` plus Tauri's IPC endpoint (`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`); `npm run test:desktop` fails if the two drift apart.
- **Recent documents and the signature** are stored per Windows user in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.nyxiontech.pdf-tools`.
- **Drag and drop** of files is handled by the page, as in the browser (Tauri's own file-drop handling is off).
- **The installers' licence page** shows the privacy policy and then the licence. `scripts/installer-license.mjs` combines `PRIVACY.md` and `LICENSE` into `src-tauri/target/installer-license.txt` before each build.

The version comes from `package.json`. Before giving the installers to users:

- **Sign them.** Releases are to be signed through SignPath Foundation (see [Code signing policy](#code-signing-policy)). Unsigned, SmartScreen warns about an unknown publisher.
- Build on Windows; the Docker image does not include the desktop app. Releases are built by GitHub Actions (see Releasing).

**Updates in the desktop app** use Tauri's updater: on start, every 30 minutes and when the window is shown again, the app reads `latest.json` from the latest GitHub release. The user can turn this off under **About** (the app then contacts GitHub only on **Check now**). If there is a newer version, a banner offers **Install and restart**. The installer is downloaded, its signature is checked against the public key in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and then it is installed and the app restarts. Documents are kept. The request is made by the app, not the page, so the page's Content-Security-Policy is unchanged.

### Releasing

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` and move the `[Unreleased]` notes in `CHANGELOG.md` under a heading for the new version.
2. Run `npm run desktop:build` and `npm run test:desktop` locally (CI builds the desktop app but cannot run its smoke tests yet).
3. Commit, then tag and push: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0`.
4. The **Release** workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) checks that the tag, `package.json` and the changelog agree. It then builds the installers on Windows and creates a **draft** release with the installers, `.sig` files and `latest.json`. The changelog section becomes the release notes.
5. Run `node scripts/fix-latest-json.mjs v1.2.0` on your PC. The draft's `latest.json` points at download links that installed apps can't use; the script replaces them with the public ones and re-uploads it. It runs locally, so it uses no GitHub Actions minutes.
6. Check the draft and click **Publish release**. Installed apps see the update only once the release is published. Run the script once more: it now also checks that every download link works.

The update files are signed with a private key that is stored in the repository secrets `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`. **Keep a backup of it.** If the key is lost, installed apps can't verify any future update, and users would have to reinstall by hand. To build signed update files locally, set `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` to the key file's path.

### Updates

Each build writes `/version.json`. The app checks it on start, every 30 minutes and when the tab becomes visible again. When a newer version has been deployed, it shows a banner offering to reload. The check only talks to the server the app was loaded from.
"What's new" and "About" in the sidebar show the running version and the history from `CHANGELOG.md`.

To release: bump `version` in `package.json`, add a section to `CHANGELOG.md`, and deploy.

### Rebranding a fork

Name, links and the donation URL (`DONATE_URL`, empty hides the link) are in `src/config.ts`. Change `.github/FUNDING.yml` too. Colours are the `--accent*` and `--dark` tokens at the top of `src/styles.css`. The wordmark is in `Shell.tsx` and `Editor.tsx`, and the favicon is in `index.html`.
Under the AGPL, a modified version that you let others use over a network must offer them its source code. Keep the "Source code" link pointing at your fork.

## Dashboard tools

The sidebar on the main screen lists every tool, grouped and searchable. Each tool has its own address, such as `/merge-pdf`, and a Polish one, such as `/pl/polacz-pdf`, where the whole interface is in Polish. An EN / PL switch at the bottom of the sidebar opens the same page in the other language. The desktop app has four more interface languages (German, Spanish, French, Ukrainian): it follows the system language, and the switch lists all six. In the desktop app tools use `#/tool/<id>` instead, and old `#/tool/<id>` links still work on the web.

![Nyxiontech PDF Tools dashboard: tool sidebar on the left, file drop zone and tool grid on the right](docs/screenshot.png)

| Group | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Edit & sign | Edit PDF, Sign PDF (draw / type / upload, with white-background removal), Fill PDF form (incl. flatten), Page numbers, Watermark, Edit metadata |
| Organize | Merge PDF, Split PDF (every page / ranges / extract), Organize pages, Rotate PDF |
| Optimize | Compress PDF (lossless repack, or rasterize at three levels) |
| Convert | OCR: searchable PDF (Polish + English), Images to PDF (incl. iPhone HEIC), PDF to images, PDF to text, PDF to Word, Word to PDF |
| Security | Protect PDF (AES-256, permissions), Unlock PDF, Redact PDF (find text, preset patterns, or draw boxes) |
| Review | Compare PDFs (text diff and visual diff per page) |
| Images | Compress & convert images (JPG/PNG/WebP, resize, strips EXIF), Remove background (on-device AI or plain colour), HEIC to JPG |
| Other | QR code generator (link, Wi-Fi, contact card, e-mail, text; PNG/SVG) |

Results can be downloaded one by one or as a .zip, and PDFs can be sent straight to the editor.

### How the heavier tools work

- **OCR**: Tesseract (tesseract.js) recognises each page; the words are added as an invisible text layer over the untouched page, so the PDF looks identical but becomes searchable. About 10 s per page at 300 dpi.
- **Redact**: pages with redactions are re-rendered as images with the boxes burnt in, so the hidden text is really gone (with all their comments and form fields). Pages without redactions stay as they are, except that comments (with their popups and replies) whose text matches a searched text or preset are removed, and matching form field values are cleared; boxes drawn by hand do not affect other pages.
- **Remove background**: U²-Net (small) runs on-device with ONNX Runtime Web; the plain-colour mode flood-fills from the image edges.
- **Word**: PDF to Word keeps text, paragraphs, bold and sizes but not tables, columns or images. Word to PDF converts .docx to HTML (mammoth) and uses the browser's print dialog ("Save as PDF"). Neither reproduces complex layouts exactly; that needs Word or LibreOffice.

### Offline assets

OCR and background removal load a worker, WebAssembly, language data and a model by URL; pdf.js loads its WebAssembly image decoders (JPEG 2000, JBIG2) and colour-profile support the same way.
`scripts/copy-assets.mjs` copies them from `node_modules` and `assets/` into `public/vendor/` (about 50 MB) before `npm run dev` and `npm run build`, so nothing is fetched from a CDN.

## Editor features

- **Dashboard**: drop one or more PDFs (several files are merged into one document) and see recent documents with thumbnails. You can open, duplicate or delete them, or remove them all with "Clear all documents" (useful on shared computers).
- **Tools sidebar** on the left, grouped and collapsible. The active tool's options (for example the default font for new text, or the whiteout colour) appear underneath and are remembered.
- **Text**: click to place it, then edit content, font, size, bold/italic, colour and opacity. Supports multiple lines and Polish characters.
- **21 fonts**, all with Polish characters and all embedded as subsets in the output:
  - Sans-serif: DejaVu Sans, Arimo, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Source Sans 3, Montserrat, DejaVu Sans Condensed, Oswald
  - Serif: DejaVu Serif, Tinos, PT Serif, Merriweather, EB Garamond, Playfair Display
  - Monospace: Cousine, Roboto Mono, DejaVu Sans Mono
  - Handwriting: Dancing Script, Great Vibes, Caveat

  Arimo, Tinos and Cousine have the same metrics as Arial, Times and Courier, so added text matches typical generated invoices. New text defaults to Arimo.
- **Whiteout / Highlight / Box**: drag to draw. The tool stays active, so you can mark several areas in a row; press Esc (or V) to go back to Select. To "change" existing text, whiteout the old text and type over it.
- **Images & stamps**: PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF or SVG (converted to PNG). Resizing keeps the aspect ratio; hold Shift to resize freely.
- **Snippets**: reusable text stamps, stored in localStorage. "Approved for payment" and "Copy – original on file" are included by default. Save any selected text as a snippet with the stamp button.
- **Pages**: drag to reorder; rotate, duplicate or delete pages; append pages from other PDFs.
- **Undo/redo** and keyboard shortcuts (listed in the sidebar).
- **Download**: writes a new PDF that keeps the original content and draws the edits on top. The file name comes from the name field in the top bar.

## How it works

| Piece | Library |
| --- | --- |
| Rendering pages | `pdfjs-dist` |
| Writing the output PDF | `pdf-lib` + `fontkit` 2 (through `src/lib/fontkitAdapter.ts`) |
| Fonts (on screen and embedded as subsets) | `dejavu-fonts-ttf` (Bitstream Vera), `@expo-google-fonts/*` (SIL OFL) |
| Local storage | `idb-keyval` |
| Password protect / unlock | `@cantoo/pdf-lib` (maintained pdf-lib fork, loaded on demand) |
| HEIC photos | `heic-to`, CSP build without `eval` (loaded on demand; LGPL-3.0, contains libheif/libde265, LGPL-3.0) |
| Zip, QR codes | `fflate`, `qrcode` |
| OCR | `tesseract.js` + `tesseract.js-core` + `@tesseract.js-data/pol`, `/eng` |
| Background removal | `onnxruntime-web` + U²-Net small (`assets/models`) |
| Word | `docx` (write .docx), `mammoth` (read .docx) |

`@pdf-lib/fontkit` is deliberately not used: it writes broken subsets when one PDF uses several custom fonts.
fontkit 2 does not have that problem; the adapter only bridges one renamed method.

Annotations are stored in *view space*: points measured from the top-left of the page as displayed, after rotation.
`src/lib/export.ts` maps them back to PDF user space for every rotation, taking the crop box into account.
The original page content is never modified.

## Adding a dashboard tool

1. Write a `Utility` in `src/utilities/`. `ui.tsx` has the shared building blocks: file drop, file list, options, run button with progress, and results with zip download. PDF operations live in `src/lib/pdfTools.ts`, image ones in `src/lib/images.ts`.
2. List it in `src/utilities/index.ts`.
3. Give its id an English and a Polish address in `TOOL_SLUGS` (`src/utilities/routes.ts`). TypeScript rejects a `Utility` whose id isn't there.
4. Give it a name and a one-sentence description in every dictionary (`tools` in `src/i18n/en.ts` and `pl.ts`); TypeScript rejects a dictionary that misses one. Put every other visible string of the tool in the dictionaries too.
5. Write its search page in `TOOL_PAGES` (`src/seo/content.ts`): title (max 60 characters), description (max 155), heading, a short introduction, steps, questions and related tools, in English and Polish. Describe only what the tool really does.

The sidebar, dashboard grid, router, static pages, sitemap and the e2e tests in `tests/e2e/routing.spec.ts` pick it up. Add the tool to `public/llms.txt` as well.

### Search pages

Search engines ignore everything after `#`, so each tool has a real page. After the normal build, the `seo-pages` plugin in `vite.config.ts` copies the built `index.html` once per tool and language and gives each copy its own title, description, canonical URL, hreflang links (en, pl, x-default), JSON-LD (WebPage, WebApplication, BreadcrumbList, FAQPage) and readable content inside `#root`. The same app loads on top and opens the tool; the content only fades in if the app hasn't started after 1.5 s. The plugin also writes `pl/index.html`, `404.html` and `sitemap.xml`, and fills the tool links into the home page's fallback content.

Guides (`src/seo/guides.ts`, e.g. `/guides/check-pdf-redaction`) are articles about a task, each in one language, so they have no hreflang links. They are built from the same `index.html` but without the app's script and stylesheet, are listed in the sitemap, and the matching tool page links to them. Describe the tool only as the code behaves.

The page that lists them is built the same way: `/guides` and `/pl/poradniki` (`guidesPath` in `src/utilities/routes.ts`, copy in `GUIDES_INDEX`), grouped by tool, one language per page but with hreflang links between the two, because unlike a guide the index exists in both. A new guide appears on it automatically; `tests/e2e/routing.spec.ts` fails if it does not. It is also the address to give a directory that asks where the documentation is.

In the browser, `src/lib/route.ts` reads the tool from the address, and in-app links switch tools with `history.pushState`, so the address bar always shows a shareable link. Pages under `/pl/` keep Polish addresses and show the Polish interface (`src/i18n`). The desktop app keeps `#/tool/<id>` routes, because its window always loads the bundled `index.html`; it follows the system language, and the switch in the sidebar overrides it.

The Polish steps in `TOOL_PAGES` quote button labels (e.g. „Anonimizuj i zapisz”). When you rename a label in `src/i18n/pl.ts`, change the quote there too.

### Social cards

Every page has its own 1200x630 card for the preview that chats, posts and search results show (`og:image`, `twitter:image`). `scripts/build-og-images.mjs` draws them with Playwright and writes them to `public/og/`, named after the page (`/pl/poradnik/skopiuj-tekst-z-pdf` becomes `pl-poradnik-skopiuj-tekst-z-pdf.png`); the English home page keeps the hand-made `public/og-image.png`.

The cards are generated from the built pages in `dist/`, not from the source, so a card cannot claim something its page does not say: the headline is the page's own `<h1>` and the line under it the first sentence of its meta description. After each render the script lifts the line clamp to check that nothing was cut off, and fails naming the page rather than shipping a card ending mid-word. Fonts are read from `node_modules`, so the same page gives the same bytes on any machine, and regenerating only rewrites the cards whose page text changed.

```bash
npm run build && npm run og:build   # after changing a title, a description or adding a page
```

The results are committed, so the normal build only copies them and needs neither Playwright nor a browser. `tests/e2e/routing.spec.ts` fails if a page points at a card that is not there, if two pages share one, or if a card is not a 1200x630 PNG.

### Links in the documentation

A link in the README that points at a renamed file or a heading that no longer exists stays broken
until somebody clicks it, and the README is the page most visitors read before deciding anything.
`scripts/check-doc-links.mjs` resolves every repository-relative link and every `#heading` in the
project's Markdown, reproducing GitHub's own anchor rules, and names the ones that lead nowhere.

```bash
npm run docs:check
```

It runs in `prebuild`, so a broken link fails the build. Everything is resolved on disk and nothing
is fetched, so it needs no network and can never fail because somebody else's site was down.
External links are left to a human.

### Telling search engines about a new page

New pages wait for the next crawl unless something tells the engines they exist. `scripts/submit-indexnow.mjs` submits them to IndexNow, which Bing, Yandex, Seznam and Naver read, using the key file in `public/` (named after the key it contains, which is how IndexNow checks the submitter controls the domain).

```bash
npm run indexnow -- --since <git-ref> --dry-run
```

That works out which guides were added since that commit, adds the tool page each one is about, because that page gained a link to it, and prints the list. Drop `--dry-run` to submit it, or pass whole addresses to submit specific pages. Either way it fetches every address first and sends nothing unless all of them answer 200: the paths come from the source tree, which is a step ahead of the deploy, so the easy mistake is submitting a page that is not published yet. Run it after the deploy is live, not after the merge.

Acceptance means queued for consideration, not indexed. Google does not take part in IndexNow; its sitemap submission is a separate job in Search Console.

## Adding an editor tool

1. Create a module in `src/tools/`. It exports either:
   - a `ModeTool`: stays active and handles pointer input on a page. `begin()` runs on pointer down and may return a drag session. Optional `defaults` and `Options` add per-tool settings to the sidebar.
   - an `ActionTool`: `run()` executes once when the tool is picked, for example to open a file dialog.
2. Add it to `TOOLS` in `src/tools/index.ts`, and give its id a name and hint under `editor.tools` in every dictionary in `src/i18n`.

The sidebar, keyboard shortcut and settings persistence pick it up automatically.
Moving, resizing and selecting existing elements are handled by `PageView` for every tool.
Use `select.ts`, `text.tsx`, `shapes.tsx` and `image.ts` as examples.

To add a font, install a package that ships TTF files and add an entry to `src/lib/fontFiles.ts`.
