# Contributing to Nyxiontech PDF Tools

Thanks for helping! Bug reports, fixes, new tools, tests and documentation are all welcome.

## Ground rules

- **Files never leave the browser.** No feature may upload documents, call third-party APIs or load scripts from a CDN. The Content-Security-Policy in `nginx/security-headers.conf` enforces this, and the tests run under it.
- Keep changes focused: one fix or feature per pull request.
- For a larger feature, open an issue first so we can agree on the approach.
- Never attach real or confidential documents to issues or tests. Generate test PDFs in `tests/global-setup.ts`.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5180
npm run typecheck
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright, against the production build
```

The README explains the architecture and how to add a dashboard tool or an editor tool.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `master`.
2. Make your change and add or update an end-to-end test in `tests/e2e/` when behaviour changes.
3. Add a line to `CHANGELOG.md` (under an `## [Unreleased]` heading at the top) for anything users will notice.
4. Make sure `npm run typecheck` and `npm run test:e2e` pass.
5. Open the pull request and describe what changed and why.

### Dependencies

Only add a dependency when it is clearly worth it, and check its licence: it must be compatible with the AGPL-3.0 (MIT, BSD, ISC, Apache-2.0, MPL-2.0, LGPL and OFL are fine). Pin exact versions in `package.json`. If the package ships in the app, regenerate the notices:

```bash
npx generate-license-file --input package.json --output notices.txt --overwrite
```

Then update Part 1 of `public/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` with it.

`npm run build` checks the result: `scripts/check-third-party-notices.mjs` fails the build if a package in `dependencies` is listed at the wrong version or missing from Part 1. `npm run notices:fix` corrects the version numbers; a package that is absent has to be added under the block for its licence by hand, because picking that block is a judgement call.

#### Regenerating the Rust crate notices

If you add or update a Rust crate in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, regenerate Part 4 with [cargo-about](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) (`cargo install cargo-about --locked --features cli`). Run it from `src-tauri/`:

```bash
cargo about generate --locked about.hbs -o ../notices-rust.txt
```

`about.toml` lists the accepted licences and limits the scan to the Windows target; the command fails if a crate uses any other licence. Replace the body of Part 4 in `public/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` with the output (LF line endings), then delete `notices-rust.txt`.

The same build check reads Part 4 against `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, so forgetting this step is caught without needing the Rust toolchain. It only checks that every crate listed is locked at that version, not the reverse: Part 4 covers the Windows target while `Cargo.lock` covers every platform.
